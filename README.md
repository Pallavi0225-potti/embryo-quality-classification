# 🧬 Embryo Quality Classification

This project uses deep learning (EfficientNet) to classify embryo images into quality grades. It also includes Grad-CAM visualizations to explain the model's decisions.

## 📁 Project Files
- `model_training.ipynb`: Full notebook with data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `Embryo_Classification_Presentation.pptx`: Presentation with video explanation.
- `/images`: Sample Grad-CAM outputs and result visuals.
